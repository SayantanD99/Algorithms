# Algorithms

In my 5th semester of engineering, I had a paper of Design & Analysis of Algorithms. 

This repository consists of General Algorithm concepts,quite basic and simple.
 
This paper was really interesting and I liked studying it.

And as a programmer , this is a very important paper. 

So, Back then I made these programs. and practiced my theory concepts.

The programs are very simple and they are based on common, well-known algorithms .

I would be happy if you could help me in improving the codes.

Do let me know , if there are any issues in the code, I will try to solve them.

Feedbacks are highly appreciated.

Thank You !
